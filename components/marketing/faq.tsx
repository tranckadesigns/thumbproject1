    q: "Do I need Adobe Photoshop?",
    a: "Yes — these are fully layered .PSD files designed for Adobe Photoshop CC and above. Most assets also open in Affinity Photo, though layer compatibility may vary.",
  },
  {
    q: "What exactly is a PSD overlay?",
    a: "A PSD overlay is a Photoshop file you place on top of your thumbnail photo. It's pre-designed to look like a real platform notification — revenue card, subscriber milestone, countdown timer, and more. You swap in your numbers and export. Done.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to customize an asset?",
    a: "Under 60 seconds for most assets. Click the text layer, type your number, export. Every layer is clearly named so there's no hunting around.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need design experience?",
    a: "None. If you can click a layer and type a number, you can use any asset in the library. These are built for creators, not designers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use these commercially — in sponsored videos or for clients?",
    a: "Yes. Every subscription includes a full commercial license. Use the assets in your own YouTube content, for clients, or in any monetized video.",
  },
  {
    q: "How often are new assets added?",
    a: `New assets are added every month across all ${categoriesConfig.length} categories. Everything added while your subscription is active is yours automatically — no extra cost, no extra steps.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    a: "Yes. No contracts, no lock-in. Cancel from your account page whenever you want. You keep full access until the end of your billing period.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between monthly and yearly?",
    a: "Same full access either way. Yearly is billed once and works out significantly cheaper per month. Most serious creators go yearly.",
